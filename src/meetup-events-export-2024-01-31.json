Bring your laptop and code along with the presentation!\n\n**Abstract:**\nIt's one thing to read about spring boot, spring data JPA and other technology. It's even better to generate a short, self-contained, correct ready-to-run example quickly. Thomas Surmann's Bootify.io web application is fabulous for learning or starting a new application.\nCome learn about the SaaS web application Bootify.io, the \"Best developer experience for starting Spring Boot apps ‚Äê best practices included.\"\nWe'll discuss and work through the following (bring your laptop if you'd like to play along):\n\n1. A tour of the free tier of great SaaS that is Bootify.io\n2. Generating many to many relationships with JPA (spring data)\n3. h2Database.com - Quick & easy all Java Database with an easy-to-use web console\n4. Then we'll swap h2 out for PostgreSQL.\n5. API generation with swagger (OpenAPI) using Bootify\n6. Thymeleaf GUI that sits alongside the APIs\n7. HTMX.org is an excellent (language-neutral) way to mix AJAX into your application for single-page app-like interactivity.\n8. We'll do all the `mvn install` work in the cloud -- no heavy downloads on wifi. How? We'll demo two cloud development environments.\n9. See how quick & easy to use GitPOD.io's free tier is for cloud development environments to explore a GitHub repository.\n10. See how quick & easy GitHub's Codespaces are to use. Currently, GitHub gives away \"up to 60 hours a month free\" of Codespaces to each user.\n\nWe'll use the sample repo [https://github.com/payne/team2](https://github.com/payne/team2) that was created in minutes using Bootify.io.\n\nThe short link for this presentation is [MattPayne.org/bootify](https://mattpayne.org/bootify).\n\n**Speaker:**\nMatt Payne is an organizer of OJUG, and a great guy.\n\n**Schedule:**\nPizza and Networking: 5:30 - 6:00\nPresentation: 6:00 - 7:00\nJetbrains IntelliJ license raffle for in-person attendees after the talk!\nPost-talk drinks and conversation too!\n\nFollow us on twitter!

It offers both batch and streaming processing capabilities, high performance and scalability, and advanced features such as window operations, event time processing, and state management.\n\nIn this presentation, we will dive into the ecosystem of Apache Flink and explore its various components, such as the DataStream API and DataSet API, and the state backends available. We will also examine real-world use cases and best practices for using Flink in your data processing pipeline.\n\n**Speaker:**\nNick Larson is the VP of Technology for Improving Omaha.

Why microservices?\n\nIF you are developing a large/complex application\nAND you need to deliver it rapidly, frequently, and reliably over a long period of time\nTHEN the Microservice Architecture is often a good choice.\n\nReactive architectures are becoming increasingly popular for organizations that need to do more, with less hardware. Reactive programming allows you to build systems that are resilient to high load.\n\nIn this session, I'll show you how to use JHipster to create a reactive microservices architecture with Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, Keycloak, and run it all in Docker. You will leave with the know-how to create your own resilient apps!\n\n**Speaker:**\nMatt Raible is a web developer, java champion, developer advocate at Okta, and an international speaker.\n\n**Schedule:**\nPizza and Networking: 5:30 - 6:00\nPresentation: 6:00 - 7:00\nJetbrains IntelliJ license raffle for in-person attendees after the talk!\nPost-talk drinks and conversation too!\nFollow us on twitter!

              "description": "A special treat for September, we have 2 great speakers from Europe on a national JUG tour stopping in Omaha -- Gerrit Grunwald from Germany, and Ivar Grimstad from Sweden -- giving 2 great talks!\n\n**Titles:**\n\n\"**Wargames - Java vulnerabilities and why you should care**\" -- from **Gerrit Grunwald** \\- Senior Developer Advocate at Azul and M√ºnster Germany JUG leader\\!\n\n\"**From Spring Boot 2 To Spring Boot 3 with Java 21 and Jakarta EE**\" -- from **Ivar Grimstad** \\- Jakarta EE Dev Advocate at the Eclipse Foundation and Malm√∂ Sweden JUG leader\\!\n\n**Wargames abstract:**\n\nJava is great and we all spend time on making it more performant, more scalable and maintainable. But we better should also spend some time on making it more secure. With all that new Java releases and features also come new vulnerabilities and exploits. Because Java is everywhere, it has a huge attack surface which makes it interesting for hackers to search for vulnerabilities in Java and foremost in Java based applications. I'm not a Java security specialist and if you are like me wonder what all these mystique acronyms like NVD, CVE, CVSS, CPU, PSU etc. mean and how they are related to Java security, come to this session and I will explain it to you. It will also be shown what tools are available to you to check whether your Java application is vulnerable to known issues.\n\n**Spring Boot / Java EE abstract:**\n\nJakarta EE 9 changed its package namespace from javax.\\* to jakarta.\\*. This may sound like a trivial change that mostly affects Jakarta EE. So, why should Spring developers care?\n\nAs it turns out, the namespace changes ripple throughout the entire Java ecosystem. And Spring is no exception. Spring Framework 6 and Spring Boot 3 raised their baseline to Jakarta EE 9 API level which is supported by Tomcat 10 and Jetty 11 for example.\n\nAttending this session will teach you how to make this migration as smooth as possible. A live coding demo will take you through the steps involved, and point out where to pay special attention.\n\nWe will also briefly examine some of the changes planned for Jakarta EE 11 that will prepare you for what to expect in future versions of Spring.\n\n**Wargames Speaker:**\n\n**Gerrit Grunwald** is a software engineer that loves coding for around 40 years already. He is a true believer in open source and has participated in popular projects like [JFXtras.org](JFXtras.org) as well as his own projects (TilesFX, Medusa, Enzo, SteelSeries Swing, SteelSeries Canvas, JDKMon).\n\nGerrit blogs regularly at [http://harmonic-code.org](http://harmonic-code.org), he is an active member of the Java community, where he founded and leads the Java User Group M√ºnster (Germany), he is a JavaOne rockstar and a Java Champion. He is a speaker at conferences and user groups internationally and writes for several magazines.\n\n**Spring Boot / Java EE Speaker:**\n\n**Ivar Grimstad** is the Jakarta EE Developer Advocate at Eclipse Foundation. He is a Java Champion and JUG Leader based in Sweden.\n\nBesides advocating the Jakarta EE technologies, Ivar is contributing to the Jakarta EE specifications as well as being the PMC Lead for Eclipse Enterprise for Java (EE4J). He is also one of the specification leads for Jakarta MVC and represents Eclipse Foundation on the JCP Executive Committee.\n\nIvar is also involved in a wide range of other open-source projects and communities.

Have you ever wondered how to build application architectures that are secure from the start? Are you using Spring, but not quite sure which projects to reach for first and how they all fit together?\n\nIn this talk, we will examine a modern application architecture including multiple secured microservices, and see how various Spring projects come together to make this work. We will learn how OAuth2 fits seamlessly into this architecture to create modern applications that are resilient, adaptable and production-ready. We will also explore using Spring Boot's OAuth2 Authorization Server support to standardize our OAuth2 configuration while providing the flexibility to connect to multiple third party identity providers.\n\n‚Äî\n\nSteve Riesenberg is a Software Engineer at VMware where he works on the Spring Security team, contributing to Spring Security‚Äôs OAuth support as well as the Spring Authorization Server.\n\nHis interests are in security, distributed systems, messaging, web development, FinTech, and JVM languages such as Kotlin. He contributes occasionally in the ZeroMQ community and dabbles in home automation.\n\nHe has extensive experience developing security solutions and APIs for online banking platforms, and has worked to deploy numerous online and mobile banking systems. He enjoys working with large teams of various skill-sets and loves thinking through the user experience from the UI to the mainframe (and back again).\n\n**Schedule:**\n\nPizza and Networking: 5:30 - 6:00PM\n\nPresentation: 6:00 - 7:00PM\n\nJetbrains IntelliJ license raffle after the talk!\n\nPost-talk drinks and conversation too!\n\nFollow us on twitter!
